SQL : General

In a nutshell, the world is driven by data.

Here are SQL database websites: 
  MySQL: https://www.mysql.com/
  PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/
  SQLite: http://www.sqlite.org/
  Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/database/index.html
  Microsoft: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016
Each understands SQL. If you learn SQL, it can be used across all the above database. Keep in mind that there are some differences in a few areas, though.

Here are NoSQL database websites: 
  MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.org/
  CouchBase: http://www.couchbase.com/
  Redis: http://redis.io/

SQL = Structured Query Language

Reading data from a database is known as querying. 

Two important components of a database: 1) data and 2) schema.

The schema determines how the data should be stored and divided into different sections. It further determines how each section relates to another section. These sections are called tables.

Columns of a table = vertical sections
  
Rows of a table = horizontal sections

Table columns of the schema are to have certain data types: text, numeric, date, etc.

Text = store names or descriptions
Numeric = prices, ages, and quantities
Date = time-related elements

Syntax = Vocabulary and grammatical structure of a programming language

The "vocabulary" words, though few, are called keywords. These are the commands issued to a computer. Lines of SQL are known as a statement (or a query).


SQL : Statement

Here is how a query might be written in English: 

What is all the information we have about each book in a table?

In SQL, it may look like the following:
  SELECT * FROM books;

Uppercase words (SELECT and FROM) are keywords

SELECT = When you want to write a query

FROM = Which table 

* = Bring all information from the columns

; = Let's database know where the statement ends (terminates)

In large applications, querying all (*) information FROM a table is unrealistic, but in smaller applications, it is fine, with no performance issues.

What if you want to select two pieces (columns) of data from a table? Simply separate the names with a comma in the SQL query.

Ex: SELECT email, firstName FROM patrons;


SQL : Filtering Information

SELECT email FROM patrons;

The above code will SELECT all email(s) FROM patrons table. If * had been used, then all data from the patrons table would have been returned.


SQL : Changing Title Columns

Use the keyword AS to change a column's name. This is known as aliasing.

SELECT title AS Title, first_published AS "First Published" FROM books;

The result will be a column with Title and one with First Published. Did you notice the double quotes around First Published? This works with some SQL databases, but not others. Some require single quotes; others require brackets. Just an FYI.

This is possible, but not helpful: The AS keyword can be removed, but it hinders readability. Just an FYI.

Moreover, the AS keyword does not change the name of the column in the actual database. Again, this is aliasing.

Note: SELECT, FROM, AS, etc . . . are all uppercase. Do these keywords need to be that way? No. Lowercase is permissible. But uppercase helps with readability and distinguishing different parts of a query.


SQL : WHERE (Conditions) and Keywords

WHERE is a keyword where you specify a condition.

SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;

Closer look at condition = <column> <operator> <value>

SELECT title, author FROM books WHERE first_published = 1997;

= . . . this is the equality operator and it is case sensitive. So, "Doug" = "Doug" is true; "Doug" = "Funny" is false

Above, if the first_published year is 1997, then title and author are returned. Also, you don't have to include first_published in the SELECT area. This reduces clutter and enhances readability.

To get books not published in 1997, use the inequality operator (!).

SELECT title, author FROM books WHERE first_published != 1997;

Here are some more operators:
  < : less than operator 
  <= : less than or equal to 
  > : greater than
  >= : greater than or equal to

What happens when you want to use more than one condition? It depends on the question you want to ask. But you can use either AND or OR.

SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = "Some Author" AND first_published < 2000;

This will yield titles that satisfy both conditions. However, if the OR keyword had been used, then different results would have been produced. When OR is used, only one of the two conditions has to be true. Again, with AND, both conditions must be true.

How can you compare multiple values? You can use multiple ORs; however, this may become verbose and messy.

Use IN keyword, instead.

After WHERE, add IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, etc)

Ex: SELECT first_name, email FROM patrons WHERE library_id IN ("MC", "MA", "MD");

Note: parentheses () and comma-separated values must be present

If you want to find first_name and email in patrons WHERE library_id is not IN ("MC", "MA", "MD"), use the NOT keyword right before IN.

Ex: SELECT first_name, email FROM patrons WHERE library_id NOT IN ("MC", "MA", "MD");

Let's say you want to express a value between a range. What's a good way to do that? Use the BETWEEN keyword.

Ex: SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> BETWEEN <minimum> AND <maximum>;

How should you be more flexible with your searches?

To add more flexibility, use the LIKE keyword instead of the equality operator (=). Now, when using LIKE, the wildcard operator (%) must be used as a substitute character.

Ex: SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE "Harry Potter%";

This will yield all Harry Potter books, regardless of specifying the volume. Now, this will only yield "all" Harry Potter books if, and this is important, "Harry Potter" is fully used. The wildcard (%) at the end of "Harry Potter" simply substitutes the missing values. For example, if one were to use "Harry Potte" as the condition, it would fail. But if the same person replaces that with "Harry Potter", all results, from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, will be returned.

In SQL, how do you represent a missing value? Use the NULL keyword. NULL cannot be used with equality operator (=); it must be used with the IS keyword or IS NOT keywords.


SQL : Two Tables

To select from two tables, insert a comma between the first and second table. In the WHERE clause, you can set up the relationship between the two tables.

Ex: SELECT * FROM <table 1>, <table 2> 
  WHERE <table 1>.<table 1 column> = <table 2>.<table 2 column>;


SQL: CRUD

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete

Each CRUD operations has a specific SQL keyword associated with it.

Create = INSERT
  Ex: INSERT INTO <table> VALUES (<value 1>, <value 2>, . . . );
  The values must be inserted in the order the schema describes the columns.

  Ex: INSERT INTO books VALUES (16, "1984", "George Orwell", "Fiction", 1949);

  If the id column has been designated as autoincrementing, you can use NULL instead of the next value. In the above example, 16 comes after 15. With autoincrementing, NULL would have produced 16 in the table.

  One problem with the above example is that it's not clear what the VALUES mean. SQL provides a handy helper.

  Ex: INSERT INTO books (id, book, author, genre, year_published) 
    VALUES (16, "1984", "George Orwell", "Fiction", 1949);

  The parentheses () after books are associated with the table names. Moreover, the names don't have to be in order. For example, if id were last, it's value would be inserted in the appropriate position if the id is moved from the first to last position. In other words, the values can be organized how you see fit and the schema will not be changed. Just make certain that the values match the column names.

  If one of the values is not specified, you could use NULL keyword. However, by leaving the area empty, SQL will know that they are to be empty. Keep in mind that the autoincrementing will adjust the id accordingly.

  While some columns allow NULL, database designers sometimes require a value. This makes sense, as some portions of the table would require a value, such as patron_id for a library table.

  Inserting Multiple Rows

  INSERT INTO books (title, author, genre, first_published) 
    VALUES ("The Circle", "Dave Eggers", "Science Fiction", 2013);
  INSERT INTO books (title, author, genre, first_published) 
    VALUES ("Contact", "Carl Sagan", "Science Fiction", 1985);
  INSERT INTO books (title, author, genre, first_published) 
    VALUES ("Animal Farm", "George Orwell", NULL, 1945);

  It's common to see multiple statements like this in files that set up the database, called database seed files. However, it's more common to see the first part of the query once, not three times. 

  INSERT INTO books 
           (title, author, genre, first_published) 
    VALUES ("The Circle", "Dave Eggers", "Science Fiction", 2013),
           ("Contact", "Carl Sagan", "Science Fiction", 1985),
           ("Animal Farm", "George Orwell", NULL, 1945);

Read = SELECT

  This information is in the SQL : Statement section and ends when SQL : CRUD begins.

Update =  UPDATE

  UPDATE <table> SET <column> = <value>;

  SET is a keyword that "sets" the value of a column.

  The equal sign in this case is not like that of a WHERE clauses. Here, in UPDATE, it's an assignment operator.

  Ex: UPDATE patrons SET last_name = "Anonymous";

  The above statement will update the last_name column with "Anonymous."

  UPDATE Multiple Values

  UPDATE <table> SET <column 1> = <value 1>, <column 2> = <value 2>;

  UPDATE patrons SET email = "anon@email.com", zip_code = 55555;

  Targeting Specific Rows

  UPDATE <table> SET <column> = value;

  If you want to target a specific row,

    Use WHERE keyword . . . 

    UPDATE <table> SET <column> = value WHERE <condition>;

Delete = DELETE

  DElETE Statement . . . 

  DELETE FROM <table>;

  DELETE FROM patrons;

  This will remove all patrons information. 

  WARNING! If you DELETE your data, you will be unable to get it back. The safe thing to do is back up your data.

  DELETE Specific Rows

  DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;


SQL : Commit

Most databases have autocommit turned on by default. Sometimes, you don't want this to be the case. So, what can you do to prevent autocommitting from occurring? Use transactions.

Transactions are an important concept to understand.

To turn off autocommit, have this at the beginning of your script . . . 

  BEGIN TRANSACTIONS; (Shuts off autocommit.)

  INSERT INTO genres (name) VALUES ("Non-fiction"); (Your statements go here.)

  COMMIT; (This will save your statements, but it cannot be undone unless UPDATE and DELETE statements are used accordingly.)


SQL : ROLLBACK

If you BEGIN your statements and soon realize that you've made a typo, use the ROLLBACK statement . . . 

  BEGIN;

  INSERT INTO genres (name) VALUES ("Non-fiction");

  ROLLBACK; (This will "rollback" to an empty table, as the values were not "committed.")
