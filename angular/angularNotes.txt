Angular

What is Angular known for? 1) SPAs (single-page applications) and 2) rapid development

Angular is a declarative programming language. In other words,
you tell the program "what to do," not "how to do it."

Angular is a framework that lives on the "client," not the server. 
For example, Express (for JavaScript), Django (for Python), and Rails (for Ruby) are for the server, not "client."

Four Angular Concepts

1) Templates (or Views) -- Hold HTML and are what structure the application
2) Directives -- Extend HTML templates with tags and attributes
3) Controllers -- Contain logic that tells application how to behave
4) Scope -- Part of the application that allows data to be manipulated
