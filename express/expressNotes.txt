Express

Express is a web-application framework for Node(.js).

Three tools are needed: 1) text editor, 2) command line (terminal), and 3) browser.

To create an Express application, let's first run npm init.

This initializes (or creates) key configurations for the project in a file, package.json. Note: Press enter throughout the questions.

Now, you should have a package.json file. Type ls to "list" the files. If ls does not work, try dir. But wait, there is something else in your project: node_modules. Why has that folder been created? Well, those are the dependencies that Express needs to run properly. 

But we need to create a .gitignore file and add node_modules; otherwise, git will track the changes of node_modules. In .gitignore, add node_modules.

It's a good habit to place application files in a directory named src (source). It makes it easier for others and yourself to know where to look to understand how the application works. Let's create an app.js file in src.

With that set up, let's create an Express app(lication).
(Head to src/app.js.)
