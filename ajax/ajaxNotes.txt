Ajax Notes : General

Query string = http://website.com/employees.php?firstName=John&lastName=Smith . . . is what comes after the question mark. It appears at the end of a URL and allows for additional information in the response.

Query strings can hold multiple value pairs. In the previous example, the ampersand (&) combined two key-value pairs.

Some characters have special meanings in URLs. Encode (or translate) into a set of symbols that are safe. 

The following link is a good reference: http://www.url-encode-decode.com/

Note: JavaScript and jQuery have methods that can do these types of conversions for you.

GET method is a great way to send information to a server; however, all of the data is sent in the URL, meaning sensitive information will appear in one's browser history. Moreover, only so much data can be transfered in the URL.

POST method puts information in the body of the request, not the URL.

Ajax is limited by a browser's "same-origin policy." Here is a resourceful link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy
