# notesForAll

This is a repository of notes and other resources. I plan to write notes with as much detail as possible so that beginners (and beyond) have an easier time learning. 

P.S. I will do my best to convey information in a cohesive manner, explaining things as I go along. If anything feels "off," or you have a suggestion, feel free to modify the notes. Seriously, feel free to make suggestions! Conveying the vastness of programming into understandable snippets and chunks is a little challenging. The more help, the better! :)

Also, if it seems as though I am repeating myself, it's to hammer home a point until it clicks. Believe me, you will know when it clicks, as you will probably do what most developers do when they come to a solidified concept: skip it. ;)

P.P.S It's best to view the notes in a text editor with word wrap on. However, if you don't want to worry about this, click the "Raw" button on this or your GitHub. It should help.
